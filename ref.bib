  abstract  = {One of the nice things about purely functional languages is that functions often satisfy simple properties, and enjoy simple algebraic relationships. Indeed, if the functions of an API satisfy elegant laws, that in itself is a sign of a good design---the laws not only indicate conceptual simplicity, but are useful in practice for simplifying programs that use the API, by equational reasoning or otherwise.},

Rather, it recounts some of my experiences over the last 15 years, working with QuickCheck, and its purpose is as much to entertain as to inform.},
